        First, determine whether the claim is True or False.

        For True claims, use the following JSON structure:
        {{
        "Final_Judgement": {{
        "Answer": "True",

        "Final_Judgement": {{
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "{{{{reasons}}}}",

        Content to be converted:
